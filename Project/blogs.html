        <h4 style="color: white">
          In Fortnite, players collaborate to survive in an open-world
          environment, by battling other characters who are controlled either by
          the game itself, or by other players. Violence is cartoonish, but some
          characters and scenes might disturb younger players. The single-player
          or co-operative mode (played with friends) involves fighting off
          zombie-like creatures. But Fortniteâ€™s most popular mode is its
          standalone free-to-play multiplayer platform, Fortnite Battle Royale,
          in which up to 100 players enter an online game, competing
          individually or as part of squads of up to four, to be the last player
          standing within a ever-decreasing battle arena.
